## Recommendations

### Utilization rate in the FCT is comparatively low. Possible solutions to remedy this include:

1. Make sure that the ATMs are visible and accessible to customers...
2. Offer incentives to customers such as waived transaction fees or cashback rewards...
3. Use various marketing channels to promote the availability and convenience of the ATM...

### Average transaction duration in Kano is longer when compared to other locations. Possible solutions to remedy this include:

1. Increase the number of ATMs available in the branch...
2. Consider upgrading the ATMs to newer models...
3. Ensure that the ATMs are regularly serviced and maintained...

## Transaction Activity

ATMs have significantly reduced activity in the early and late hours of the day (Before 5 am and after 8 pm). Lagos is the only exception as there is still noticeable activity after 8 pm.

Scheduled maintenance should coincide with these periods of reduced activity. Additionally, ATMs should have maximum availability, especially during the peak activity periods for each bank branch
