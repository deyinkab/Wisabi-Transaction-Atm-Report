## Transaction Activity

ATMs have significantly reduced activity in the early and late hours of the day (Before 5 am & After 8 pm). Lagos is the only exception as there is still noticeable activity after 8 pm.

Scheduled maintenance should coincide with these periods of reduced activity. Additionally, ATMs should have maximum availability especially during the peak activity periods for each bank branch.
